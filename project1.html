                    <h2>DC to DC Voltage Multiplier</h2>
                    <p>
                        As part of the study of circuit design using semiconductor diodes and field-effect transistors, 
                        this project aimed to create a voltage doubling circuit simulating a battery powered device. 
                        Although the core of this project was to double a DC voltage only an AC voltage supply was allowed. 
                        This supply would have to be converted to a DC voltage before doubling. A restriction was also placed 
                        on using any kind of pulse generating integrated circuits, such as the 555 timer IC. After designing 
                        a half-wave rectifier circuit to convert the AC voltage to a DC voltage, my team and I decided on using 
                        a boost converter circuit to achieve the output voltage required. A working boost converter circuit 
                        needs a pulse signal to be sent to a transistor. This meant that my we had to 
                        make our own pulse generating circuit. After much deliberation and testing, we settled on using a 
                        stable NAND gate oscillator circuit to produce the signal needed for the transistor. By calculating 
                        the values of the resistors and capacitor, we were able to produce a clocking signal with a duty 
                        cycle of 50%. The rectifier, NAND gate oscillator, and boost converter circuits were designed and 
                        tested using the simulation software SPICE. After seeing that the circuits worked together as desired, 
                        we constructed the physical circuit and ran tests. With no load, the rectifier circuit gave a voltage 
                        output of 9.57 volts with less than 0.2% voltage ripple. This 9.57 volt output was then doubled to 
                        19.82 volts with the boost converter circuit.Testing the circuit with loads of 5kÎ© and greater, the 
                        output was consistently around 20 volts. The full circuit diagram is shown here on the page and if
